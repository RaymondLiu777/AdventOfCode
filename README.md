# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is yearly event where everyday up until Christmas, a coding puzzle is released. 

This is a master repo containing all of my solutions since 2022 (I used to have a sepeerate repo for each year, but they were merged together in 2024). Refer to README's in individual years to seem my goals for each year.
