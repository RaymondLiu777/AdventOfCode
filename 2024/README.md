# Advent of Code 2024

This year I once again try to compete for leaderboard positions with a goal of getting a placement of < 1000. Along the way, I built out my AoC infrastructure with an improved helper library and better automation for input retrieval.

# Final Rankings:

 Overall I am very happy with my scores, mostly ending up around the 1000-3000 mark. There's a few days where I wasn't able to do the puzzle when it was released resulting in particularly low scores (day 12 and day 17 part 2) but I'm also very happy about day 24 part 2, my highest score ever!
