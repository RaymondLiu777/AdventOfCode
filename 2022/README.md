# Advent of Code 2022

Advent of code is a yearly event where everyday up until Christmas, a coding puzzle is released. 

Since I have never used python before, I have decided to try to code all the solutions in python. Although I do not try for spots on the leaderboard, the challenge for myself is to solve the puzzles in as little time as possible, so solutions may be hacky and messy.
